  title: About Us
  description: >-
    CorpCare is a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) strategy and execution
    firm for businesses and philanthropists seeking to give and do more for
    their communities. We bridge the gap between available resources (financial
    or in-kind) and community needs. For small and medium-sized enterprises, we
    serve as an outsourced CSR department. For large-scale enterprises, we
    consult on how to structure CSR spending and activities to ensure every
    dollar is as impactful as possible.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
