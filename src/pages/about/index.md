Corp**Care** is a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) strategy and execution firm for businesses and philanthropists seeking to give and do more for their communities. We bridge the gap between available resources (financial or in-kind) and community needs. For small and medium-sized enterprises, we serve as an outsourced CSR department. For large-scale enterprises, we consult on how to structure CSR spending and activities to ensure every dollar is as impactful as possible.



**OUR MISSION**

To strengthen the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) landscape in Jamaica by providing companies with strategic, impact-driven solutions for giving back to their communities.



**OUR VISION**

A Corporate Jamaica that serves all Jamaicans. 



**HOW WE WORK: The Business Model**

Work done by Corp**Care** follows a 3-pronged approach, as is outlined below. 

1. **Identifying and vetting recipients of CSR dollars or in-kind donations.** Projects for impact investment are identified based on our client company’s goals, Corp**Care** core M&E metrics and through partnerships with reputable non-profit organisations like 876Volunteer, DoGoodJamaica and Mustard Seed Communities.
2. **Developing unique calendars for CSR activities for every client and executing on the activities outlined by our mutually agreed upon strategy.**Corp**Care** Client Officers act like project managers for every impact investment made, monitoring of project outcomes and liaising with clients to ensure every client need is met.
3. **Monitoring and evaluating (M&E)** every CSR activity through our previously determined M&E guidelines, traditional data analytics through BlueDot and qualitative analysis by Corp**Care**public policy and development specialists.

For large-scale clients with existent CSR departments or associated foundations, Corp**Care** functions akin to a traditional consultancy firm. The value-add of working with Cop**Care** instead of a traditional consultancy firm is that CorpCare is a non-profit organization and makes client companies eligible for tax benefits. Any income earned that exceeds Corp**Care**’s needs (to cover operating costs) will be pooled into an investment fund which will accrue interest over the fiscal year and distributed as an independent, Corp**Care** grant at the end of that period.

The Corp**Care** costing structure follows a sliding-scale model and allows for significant flexibility. For example, if 5 small companies are interested in large-scale CSR projects but don’t have the resources to execute on them independently, Corp**Care**team members will treat the group of companies as one client, pooling their resources and executing accordingly. On the flip side, large-scale for-profit companies that hire Corp**Care** will be charged market-standard consultancy fees.
