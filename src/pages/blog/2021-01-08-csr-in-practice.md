  Considered a comprehensive business model, Corporate Social Responsibility
  (CSR) accounts for an organization’s direct and indirect impact on all of
  their stakeholders. This process hinges on internal accountability as very few
  CSR legislations exist worldwide.




  CSR stakeholders typically include the company’s internal and external
  communities (the people), the environment (the planet), and shareholders (the
  profit).




  To successfully address a corporation’s responsibilities, CSR strategies
  should not only be implemented, but measured and evaluated. These actions give
  a company the ability to quantify the impact of its efforts, or lack thereof,
  on people and the environment, take action to course-correct when the results
  do not align with the goals of the initiatives originally outlined, and gain
  clarity on how to strategically plan for the future.

The role companies play in disrupting the normative behavior of societies and government often outweighs that of any other institution. *Anita Roddick, Business as Usual (2000) wrote “In terms of power and influence you can forget about the church, forget politics. There is no more powerful institution in society than business... The business of business should not be about money, it should be about responsibility. It should be about public good, not private greed.”*

In January of 2020 Starbucks announced their aspiration“to become resource positive – giving back more than we take from the planet” by targeting a reduction in carbon, waste, and water. On July 21, 2020 they announced their commitment to the Transform to Net Zero initiative as a founding member, and onSeptember 10, 2020, they announced the rollout of straw-less lids across company-operated and licensed stores in the United States and Canada in an effort to eliminate one billion plastic straws globally per year (Starbucks 2020). The company publishes an annual Global Impact Report to disclose these and other initiatives, and the actions that were undertaken to realize their commitment to Corporate Social Responsibility.

These moves taken by Starbucks reflect an understanding of their privilege as a powerful for-profit organization and underscore the need for companies like them to be responsible for their impact on the world around them. Many different philosophies explore a company’s personhood in an attempt to figure out how this ‘individual’ should be monitored and held accountable; an intuitive way to apply this to a CSR model is with the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) approach.

So, what exactly is CSR? According to Carroll’s Pyramid of Corporate Social Responsibility, a firm’s structure is made up of four components:

* economic,
* legal,
* ethical,
* and philanthropic,
* with economic performance supporting the entire structure.

This pyramid shows a business’ operations and impact as measured against four different metrics. Since profit-maximization has traditionally been a company’s primary goal, other stakeholders are often overlooked and sometimes relegated as secondary to survival. However, to be considered responsible, a firm must demonstrate its usual commitment to being profitable and also ensure that its operations contribute to the well-being of its natural and social environments (Hart, Mark, and Joseph 2003, Dyllick and Hockerts 2002, Elkington 1998). A revised model of Carroll’s CSR pyramid then shows that the lines between components are blurred and it is difficult to have these components operate independently of each other. While this is a better representation of a business, as these components are not independent, this new pyramid creates a question of how to divide resources amongst all components.

**How does a business generate a profit, while protecting the environment and having a positive impact on society?**

An effective Corporate Social Responsibility approach manages this self-regulation in three phases:

Incubation– defining the company’s purpose and identifying material issues, demonstrating the willingness to take ownership of sustainability and identifying opportunities to take action;

Launching– checking-in with intimate stakeholders to ensure the plan resonates throughout the company and encourage ownership to make it sustainably a part of each employee’s job; and

Entrenching– implementing the strategies and necessary tools, and monitoring feedback and key performance indicators (KPIs). “Small actions on everybody’s part will lead to big differences: a future-proof company with engaged, productive employees, and a healthier planet”(Bhattacharya 2008).

***If the well-being of other stakeholders isn’t built into a company’s value system and given equal priority, the internal and external pressures to meet financial-performance targets can make it difficult to remain focused on the bigger picture.***

This means that an authentic commitment to CSR is founded on a framework that implements business-wide strategies that comprehensively account for the welfare of all stakeholders. Being responsible is therefore a demonstration of the firm’s commitment to perform along three measures, rather than a single measure, i.e., their “triple bottom line” contribution to profits, people, and the planet (Wheeler and Elkington 2001).
