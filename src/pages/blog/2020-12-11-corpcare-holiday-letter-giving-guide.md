Dear readers,



Happy Holidays! This year has been a particularly challenging one. As we continue to grapple with the covid-19 pandemic and the associated economic downturn, we feel it important to connect with our communities.



In hopes of making life even just a tiny bit better for those whose days have felt longer and harder, we have put together a Giving Guide of organizations, charities and funds in and around Jamaica who could benefit from a little extra support this holiday season.



We hope you are able to donate or volunteer time. We hope too that our communities benefit from these engagements in ways that extend beyond financial and professional support, and result in a renewed belief in our collective humanity.



Thank you to our CorpCare community for constantly supporting our nascent and growing organisation, sharing the resources we shed light on and for connecting with us on and offline. It is your support that keeps us going.



Thank you to everyone who contributed to this list, which is constantly being updated.



**Seasons Greetings,**

**\- The CorpCare team**





# GIVING GUIDE



### TREATING A PLACE OF SAFETY FOR CHRISTMAS

Led by Centred (<http://centredja.com/>)

\
“We are raising funds to donate 55 guided journals to youth residing in a Place of Safety (a residential facility for youth who have been removed from dangerous home environments to ensure their immediate safety, while a longer-term housing solution is determined). We also have 28 ceramic mugs (from Mustard Seed communities) as gifts for the staff members who dutifully work to create a healthy and comfortable environment for the youth in their care. We need YOUR HELP to deliver our goal, with your generous donations.



Please fill this form out with your donation, name, and email for our records. We will email a donation receipt to you once we receive it.



Thank you in advance for supporting us in executing this important initiative!”

### Prison Reform Charity Drive: Sister Support Initiative



Main Goal:

Provide women prisoners with the necessary sanitary goods for proper hygiene. Through love, care and attention we can help reform our inmates so that they can grow to become contributing members of society.



Why It Is Necessary:

Many depend on visits from their family members to get basic sanitary items. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, prisons have stopped family visits to prevent the spread of the virus within the institutes. While we recognize this is a necessary evil due to how easily the virus can spread, it should not be an excuse to leave women in deplorable conditions and in desperate need for basic things such as soap and sanitary pads.



How It Will Work:

Local charity Kind Hearts will be working in tandem with the Kingston branch of Justices of the Peace through their own JP’s Jacqueline Stewart-Lechler and James Lechler. We will be taking donations of physical supplies that will be handed over to the Ministry of Justice so that it can be distributed properly. Cash donations will also be accepted through the Richard & Diana Stewart Foundation. Any cash that is given will be directed towards buying more supplies or facilitating the transport and delivery of the goods.
